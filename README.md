# Converting a Website into A Component Based react site

> * This is a small project in which I converted a simple web page(html + css)
 into a react app.
> ` './template/index.html' ` is converted into React App.

> * During this hands-on ` "React-Architecture/Folder structure" ` laong with how components are being rendered or loaded into ` index.js ` through ` App.js `.

> * Also I learnt functional programming approach for components. And how to use components to load at runtime: and came to know the ` jsx `  syntax
